            Myself Prosenjit Ray. I received my bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science and engineering, and since then, I&apos;ve been studying web programming for the last seven months in an effort to work as a professional web developer. Working with computers and other technology has always been fun for me. I started utilizing HTML and CSS in 2022Â to make minor adjustments to a small company website that I was in charge of. What began as a few little adjustments turned into a passion for programming.

            Because of how complicated programming can be, I was instantly compelled to learn more about it. My enthusiasm for building interactive websites increased as I started learning javascript. After that, I enrolled in Jhankar Mahbub&apos;s web development course. I now spend my time learning about new technologies and developing applications using React JS, Firebase, and MongoDB.
